First, add your fonts to 

pre. public/fonts

Then, do a little bit of:

pre. sudo gem install jitai
rake jitai:refresh

Jitai automatically converts your ttf fonts into eot format, so now you have the following stylesheets to your disposal:

  * fonts_moz.css, Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Opera compatible

All of your custom fonts are now avaiable in your CSS files. For example, if you were to use the Yardsale font:

pre. font-family: "yardsale"
